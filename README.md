# ABSTRACT
Will Russia make use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine? Will China invade Taiwan in the next 6 or so months? Will the Federal Reserve take interest rates from 3.5% ~ 3.75% to 10% this year? These are all questions that the general public — and to a certain extent, professional forecasters — would consider "unknowable ahead of time." God's Eye rejects the idea that "unknowable" means "untradeable." Theoretically? Sure, Russia **could** glass Ukraine tomorrow. China **could** invade Taiwan next week. The Federal Reserve **could** bump rates to 10% this March. Will they?

Most overwhelmingly, no.

And I'd venture to say, they won't.

I know with enough certainty to risk loss of capital, and that is the only standard of conviction I accept.

The purpose of God's Eye is to detail a constraint-based system - mine - and how such frameworks can be monetized.

# CORE
Constraint is defined as a limitation or restriction. What stops us, humans, from punching through six-inch concrete pillars? Physics and anatomy. Our body simply does not possess the raw strength capable of performing such extraordinary feats. In this sense, physics is a constraint. Our skin and flesh and bones, being that much weaker than six-inches of concrete, is a constraint. Our mind, willfully stopping us from even attempting to do so, is a constraint.

All of reality is based on constraints, and markets are based on reality's future, some say. 

I reject this.

Markets are not predictions of the future. Markets are prices assigned to all possible paths of the future.

Let me demonstrate: "Will China invade Taiwan by 01/01/2027?" Invade, in this context, means to seize the whole of Taiwan via military means. I offer you 2:1 odds. I say no.

A rational decision maker — or a gambling man — would infer the odds tilt towards 'No' being the most probable outcome. Something like 66% no, 33% yes — except, yes pays twice as much as no. The question then isn't: "Is this a good bet?" The question becomes: "If we were to fast forward to 01/01/2027, and re-run the entire year of 2026, in how many re-runs of our alternate history did China elect to take Taiwan? Out of 100, 1000, or 10000 alternate re-runs, how many of those re-runs did the bet resolve to, "Yes, China invaded Taiwan?" Did China take Taiwan 33% of the time? 40% of the time? Did China invade Taiwan 100% of the time? How about 0% of the time? If the answer clusters near zero across repeated re-runs of histories, then the constraint — not the odds — dominates the outcome.

You can see now the dilemma.

The bet and its odds are downstream of the premise, and the premise is downstream of the constraints. The question then has to be asked: How likely is it that China takes Taiwan before 01/01/2027? Once we ascertain — as reasonably as one could - the odds of that happening, only is the bet and its odds relevant.

To summarize: the odds are irrelevant without an understanding of the constraints governing an outcome. 

God's Eye does not ask, "What could happen?"

God's Eye asks "What is allowed to happen repeatedly without breaking reality?"

# PURPOSE
God's Eye is a framework, more than anything - a way of thinking. It makes no claim to predictive models or certainties derived from algorithms. Tools used are secondary to judgement.

# SCOPE LIMITATION
God's Eye is deliberately incomplete. Any framework claiming finality in markets is already doomed to fail.
