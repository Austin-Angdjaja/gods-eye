# RISK, DEFINED
What is your understanding of risk? Is risk, in your mind, equivalent to loss? If so, what kind of loss? Permanent loss? Temporary loss? Big losses? Small losses? Losses you foresaw? Losses you didn't expect?

Modern finance struggles to define risk cleanly, simply because risk itself bears no concrete, universally accepted definition. In some cases, risk is equivocated to volatility. I reject this. My understanding and definition of risk differs from that of a Victorian peasant living in 1877; theirs differs again from portfolio managers working the JP Morgan floor.

We all have various understandings and definitions of risk, and to argue what risk is, universally, would be a fruitless endeavor. So instead, let me put forth a hypothetical.

Consider the following premise: 
> You have USD $20,000 in your brokerage account. You cannot add more. You decide to fully bet all USD $20,000 into a 5% OTM 1dte QQQ put. Translated, that means: if the NASDAQ doesn't drop — and drop extremely hard and extremely fast — tomorrow, you lose all USD $20,000. If, by some miracle of heaven, the U.S. government decides to outlaw share buybacks and dividends for all U.S. listed stocks tomorrow, and the NASDAQ crashes 10% on open, you net — let's say — USD $750,000.

Question: would you consider this risky?

I would say so.

I would say, very much so.

You are essentially risking 100% of your portfolio betting on a single, multi-sigma day event, the likes of which has a very, very low chance of manifesting.

To those of you asking: "What're the chance, though?"

I applaud you — that's the right question to ask.

In this case, however, that question is irrelevant. Why, you ask?

Notice, USD $20,000 is your **entire** bank roll. Everything you have.

What are the consequences of this move — that which I liken to the financial equivalent of a kamikaze? What are the most likely future outcomes for tomorrow?
1. Normal trading day: You lose USD $20,000.
2. Good catalyst, NASDAQ rallies: You lose USD $20,000.
3. Bad catalyst, NASDAQ drops, but not hard enough: You lose USD $20,000.
4. Extremely bad catalyst, NASDAQ crashes: You win USD $750,000, a profit of 37.5x your original capital. Well done.

The most likely outcome in this scenario is — you lose. 

Notice I didn't say, "you were wrong." 

No, you lose.

You lost.

Losing, in this case, means you hit $0.

Here's the God's Eye mandate:

### "The risk of ruin must be minimized, eliminated, or held as close to zero as reality allows."

Translated: before anything, you take the chance of hitting $0 out of the equation, and if that's not possible, you take that chance as close to 0%. Compounding is a byproduct of survival.

# OF HORIZONS AND TIMEFRAMES
When you trade or invest, think of the horizon. Do you want to be doing this again a month in the future? A year? What about a decade? Or the rest of your lives?

You optimize not for this trade, specifically, but for dozens, hundreds, thousands of trades. You optimize not for days or weeks, but for months, years, decades ahead.

What does that look like? That looks like hedging, dynamic sizing, profit-taking, and portfolio rebalancing — all in service of not hitting zero. 

Consider the following two trades:
1.  90% chance of winning, 10% chance of losing. Winning nets you +200%, losing nets you -100%
2.  65% chance of winning, 35% chance of losing. Winning nets you +150%, losing nets you -40%.

At first, this looks easy. Kelly Criterion solves this problem, no questions asked. You pick trade 1, you size appropriately, repeat for a week, and then retire to Malibu. Simple.

Now let's inject some nuance.

Consider also, the rules of the two trades:
- Once you've selected either trade, you have to take that same trade 10 more times.
- Each time you trade, you have to "all-in" your entire account.

Now it gets interesting, because now the risk is no longer losing a trade — it is being eliminated from the game.

This same logic applies to everyday markets, and portfolio management.

Before entering a trade, stop to think: "Regardless of the outcome of this trade, if I were offered the opportunity to re-run this trade 100 times in an alternate history, would I take that chance every time?" If the answer is no — or even hesitation — reassess.

# RISK, RE-DEFINED
So what is risk, then? For the purpose of God's Eye, risk is **what kills you.**

That's it.

A common misconception is that the market is a place where being wrong is punished. True. Being wrong loses you money.

However, there is being wrong, and then there is losing.

Big difference.

Being wrong is acceptable.

Being wrong multiple times is acceptable.

What is **not** acceptable, is being too wrong.

Worst yet, being too wrong, too many times.

As a trader, your primary goal in the market is to survive. Survival stands above all else. Survival affords you time, and time affords you compounding. The longer you stay in the market, the better and harder your capital compounds. Always remember: survival first, then profits. Everything is secondary to survival.

Trade offer:
1. 70% chance you win, 30% chance you lose. Winning nets you +500%, losing nets you -100%.
2. 20% chance you win, 80% chance you lose. Winning nets you +30%, losing nets you -5%.

Which is riskier?

Is it trade 1, because the chance of ruin exists, and is material? Is it trade 2, because the chance of losing is 4x the chance of winning?

If you answered, "neither, it depends on how you play the trade," then you've started understanding risk.

# CONCLUDING
There is nothing in the market that is inherently "risky." You may have heard of the phrase, "high risk, high reward." This assumes risk works linearly, and translates 1:1 to the degree of potential payout. In markets — and in life — risk does not map 1:1 to payouts. What matters is not your chances of winning a particular trade. What matters is not your expected payout. What matters is first and foremost, your survival, and survival boils down to how you approach a particular situation.

Or in other words: risk is not what you trade, but how much of yourself you put behind it.
