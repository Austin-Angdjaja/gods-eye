# WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW
There is always uncertainty in the market, that much is a fact. To confidently say that you are "sure" of a particular investment / trade is downright amateur and speaks volumes of your time in the market. Risk managers are never "certain" of anything — that's the whole point of risk management.

Get comfortable with the idea that the default operating environment is one where you:
1. Do not have all the facts.
2. Do not know anything for certain.
3. Do not know, what you do not know.

In other words — you can never eliminate uncertainty, only reduce it.

Any one claiming otherwise is prone to blowing up.

# WHAT YOU DO KNOW
This is more important than most people give credit for. Since there are infinite variables, most of which you do not know, and others which you do not know, you do not know, it is important that you fully understand what you do know. A bit of advice:
1. Start with the facts.
2. Start with what matters most.
3. Start with viewpoints that oppose yours.

Number 1. gives you an idea of the situation at hand.

Number 2. gives you an idea of the factors most likely to materially influence the stock price.

And number 3, most importantly, forces you to consider opposing viewpoints, which is absolutely invaluable given that it offers you the opportunity to see **if** and **where** you might be wrong. Details matter, and over the course of years and decades, there will be times where a single detail derails your entire thesis.

# CONCLUDING
A slightly shorter chapter, and one I consider not writing at all, to be honest. Nevertheless, I've found that the mistake most people make is trying to be "certain" or "sure" of a trade / investment. That cannot be done. Some have wasted lives in pursuit of this holy grail. It does not exist. Get comfortable with that fact.
