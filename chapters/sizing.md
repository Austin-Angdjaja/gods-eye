# SIZE RESPONSIBLY
When you go to the bar, you don't simply order 13 bottles of beer, and chug it all on the spot, do you? You order a few, have some laughs, drink those, and then see how you're feeling.

Sizing is similar. Sizing is, in essence, the art of deciding "how much to risk."

Consider the following premise:
> You have cash of USD $1,000,000. You decide it's time to start investing. After the better part of a few hours, you've narrowed your search down to a few companies. You have:
>
> 1. Fahrenheit Mining Co.: A junior miner based in Nevada. They're in the process of developing a fully integrated supply chain with the sole purpose of mining, refining, and developing rare-earth magnets. Fahrenheit Mining Co. has worrying debt, but management asserts that cash flow is sufficient. They have also been in operation since 1999, and are expecting profits in 2027 Q1. Currently partnered with the U.S. Department of Defence and the U.S. Department of Energy.
>    
> 2. Corvyd Collective & Co.: A technology company based in Shanghai. Corvyd Collective & Co. develops, manufactures, and distributes information technology solutions and other such computer products. Negative EBITDA since 2011. Key customers of the company include: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, AMD, and Intel. A particular market favorite, and media coverage has been extremely bullish recently.
>  
> 3. McKay's: A global investment bank based in Brussels, with over 100+ years of history. McKay's has over USD $3T in AUM, and is planning to start offering crypto and crypto-related banking services. McKay's stock price has seen only modest gains the past 5 years, underperforming the SPY500 substantially and the NASDAQ even more so.

What do you do? Invest in all of them? Pick the better of the three, and full port your USD $1,000,000 into it? Perhaps you'd like to slice your portfolio into equal thirds and allocate 33% into each? What about 50/50 into two, and ignore the last? The truth is, there is no definitive "best" answer here, as there are rarely any in the market. 

There are only right answers, and wrong answers.

The right answer is — you reduce risk of ruin, then you think of odds, and then payoffs.

The wrong answer is — anything that disrespects the former.

Remember: survive, then optimize.

You may choose to:
1. Allocate 1/3rd to each company equally.
2. Allocate 50%/35%/15% according to preference.
3. Overweight one, allocate the remaining capital to the rest.
4. Overweight two, allocate the remaining capital to the rest.

Or any combination at all.

These are all "right."

By investing equally in all companies, you essentially negate the chance of a random, one-off event — the black swan — wiping you clean. Say, for instance, the DoD and DoE drops Fahrenheit Mining Co., contracts get pulled, their revenue stream evaporates, and debt eats them alive. Chapter 11 two months later.

An equal allocation means that their bankruptcy translates to about a -33% loss for your portfolio. Material, yes, but not terminal. A -33% loss is recoverable.

What about a -50% loss?

What about -100%?

And before you think to yourself, "well, I'm far smarter than that. No way I invest in a company that'll go bankrupt!"

Might I remind you — Enron caught the world by surprise.

So did Evergrande.

So did Theranos.

So will many more in the future.

In the words of Mark Twain: "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."

Horizons and timeframes, my friend.

What does it look like to be "wrong" then?"

What does "wrong" sizing look like?

Wrong sizing looks like a bad trade / investment eliminating you from the markets completely. Wrong sizing looks like forced liquidation or a margin call. Wrong sizing looks like being forced to take action / a course of action you would otherwise never take under normal circumstances.

In other words, position sizing is how you preserve future optionality. Oversizing is the act of stealing from your own future.

# THE CASE FOR JUDGEMENT
By now you've noticed that there's really no concrete rules governing my sizing. You are correct. Judgement plays a big part in God's Eye. Ultimately, what weighting a particular position deserves is a question you, yourself, must answer. Some people might push harder for a more speculative investment; others may choose to be more prudent, preferring a more diversified outlook.

Regardless, you must ensure that your judgement serves you right.

A single trade / investment going bad must not be allowed to kill you.

Neither is a few.

It is imperative you adopt a similar mindset. If you can't reasonably look at a particular trade / investment, and objectively say that "even if this thing goes to zero, I'll be fine," then reassess. You will be wrong on some trades. You will be wrong on some investments.

Again, I repeat: being wrong is tolerable, losing is not.

> A bit of advice: If any particular trade / investment makes you anxious, or you feel an overwhelming sense of need to sit and stare and micromanage, you are oversizing.

# THE CASE FOR CONTEXT
A lot in the market boils down to numbers. A lot in the market also boils down to context. It is for this reason that one must develop their own intuitions for sizing. Sizing is, by nature, principle-driven, judgement-heavy, context-sensitive, and very much so personal. Understand that what you consider good sizing, may be what others consider over/under sizing, and vice versa.

Sizing is not about maximum returns. It is about ensuring that, whatever happens, you are still standing at the end of the day. Remember, the market does not reward conviction. It rewards those who can afford to be wrong repeatedly.

# AND THE CASE FOR BEING WRONG
Most people blow up not because they were wrong, but because they put themselves in a position where being wrong ends their run. Simple as that. I know there's that little voice in the back of your head that's saying, "well, all of this is fine and dandy, but I just won't be wrong, then. I'll read filings often, I'll keep up with news, I'll only buy good companies, etc..."

That little voice has a name.

It's name is ego.

Ego convinces you that you are infallible.

Ego convinces you that you are good enough, and smart enough, and better than everyone else, and that you will make no mistakes. You will **never** be wrong. You will **never** blow up. You **can't** lose.

Reality says otherwise.
- You will misjudge fundamentals.
- You will misread narratives.
- You will be early.
- You will be late.
- You will be right for the wrong reasons.
- You will be wrong for the right reasons.

Understand, now. You **will** be wrong, there is simply no avoiding that.

It is guaranteed you will take hits.

It is guaranteed you will lose money.

It is guaranteed your P/L will suffer.

Again, all fine.

And again, horizons and timeframes, my friend.

# CONCLUDING
People think of sizing as, "if I'm careful enough, I can mostly avoid being wrong."

I'm here to tell you: it's not about not being wrong. It's about the one time you were.

Over years and decades, you **will** be wrong.

Size so you don't blow up if something bad happens. 

Size because bad outcomes are the default in markets, not the anomaly.

Black swans are just the cherry on top.
