# TERRAIN MAPPING
One of the most important aspects of war is terrain; good generals know this, great generals live this. If you see your enemy has heavily fortified an uphill position, and your only avenue of attack is through a wide, open field, you'd think better than to send your men to the grinder. Yet, for whatever reason, we seem to think differently in markets.

If sizing is "how much of yourself you put behind a trade / investment," positioning is, "where you stand."

This usually translates to:
- Are you bullish or bearish?
- Are you long or short?

Consider, however, an alternative approach. Instead of the traditional bullish / bearish, long / short mindset, consider:
- How do I monetize a perceived, future state?

The reason I say this is because price, over the short term, tends to deviate from any such logic or rationale. I'm sure we've all seen a stock beat earnings by miles, and still get sold off into oblivion on open. I'm sure we've all sat on the losing side of a trade, wondering, "why the hell is this thing going up / down? XYZ happened! That's supposed to be good / bad! Why is it doing that? This makes no sense!"

As is the saying, markets are indeed irrational.

Your task, as a trader / investor, is to make sense of this irrationality and, despite its persistence, persevere still.

# THE GOD'S EYE VIEW
When you look at a particular trade, what exactly is the first thing that comes to mind? "Where is price going to be (XYZ timeframe) from now?" God's Eye rejects this price-first, everything-second mindset. But first, let's lay out the facts:
1. The price of any particular asset class may either go up, down, or sideways.
2. Price may deviate greatly, slightly, or not at all, from the asset's inherent worth.
3. An asset's inherent worth is not knowable.
4. Worth does not equal to value.
5. Value does not equal to price.
6. Price is not the market's objective truth.
7. Mispricing happen, and happen **very often.**

If the market is truly efficient, as some of us are led to believe in academia, then logic dictates that mispricing is impossible. Any mispricing will be swiftly arbitraged or traded away, thereby erasing it completely.

Again, false. God's Eye rejects this.

Consider the factors associated with a stock's price.

I'll make it simple.

Consider the factors that may affect Coca-Cola's business, its performance, and consequently, its stock.
1. Competitors such as Pepsi affect Coca-Cola.
2. FDA regulations affect Coca-Cola.
3. Consumer taste affects Coca-Cola.
4. Consumer taste tomorrow affects Coca-Cola.
5. The global economy affects Coca-Cola.

I could go on, but you understand my point.

God's Eye rejects fair value as a usable object, not because value doesn't exist, but because it is conditional, unstable, and untradeable in real time. Let me ask: "Does consumer spending affect Coca-Cola stock?"

Of course, it does. More discretionary income means more spending, and more spending means more willingness to purchase non-essentials such as our beloved hero in red, Coca-Cola. Except consumer spending isn't static, is it? Consumer spending changes with the times. Why, I'd argue consumer spending changes by the day.

By the hour, even.

By the minutes and seconds.

If even by only seconds or decimal points, your proposed "fair value" is always, by nature, outdated.

So how do we perceive the market, that is ultimately made up of prices, and prices that which determine the fate of our capital?

# EXPOSURE, NOT OPINIONS
Abandon the idea that a position is a statement of your belief. Most people think of positions as opinions:
- "I'm long this company because I think it's undervalued."
- "I'm short because this ticker is way too overhyped."
- "I'm bullish into earnings."
- "I'm bearish because rates are going up."

While this framing is intuitive, it's also wrong.

A position is not an opinion 

A position is exposure.

God's Eye treats positioning not as, "what do I think will happen," but as:
> "If any one of the several plausible futures materializes, what happens to me?"

While this may seem like semantic, I assure you, it is not.

This is foundational.

# STATES, NOT PRICES
Markets do not resolve to price. They resolve to states. Price is merely a residual of this state transition. Over any horizon or timeframe that matters, assets do not move materially because a model recalculated fair value, or an algorithm sells arbitrarily, or a spreadsheet updates.

They move because the market has shifted regimes:
- From panic to calm.
- From liquidity to illiquidity.
- From narrative dominance to narrative decay.
- From policy tailwind to policy headwind.
- From risk-on to risk-off.

These are not so much prices, but conditions — regimes.

Ask not:
- "Will this stock go up or down?"

But ask:
- "What happens if volatility expands, here?"
- "What happens if narrative breaks?"
- "What happens if liquidity disappears and I'm still in?"
- "What happens if nothing happens at all?"

At all times, regardless of instrument, you are ever exposed to a finite number of market variables:
- Direction.
- Volatility.
- Time.
- Liquidity.
- Correlation.
- Convexity.

Every position is simply a weighted bundling of these exposures. Calling a position "long" or "short" collapses this bundle into one dimension and disregards the rest. This simplification may be tolerable for casual participants, but it is fatal to anyone attempting to survive uncertainty.

God's Eye treats positioning as explicit exposure selection.

# STATES, NOT PRICES (CONTINUED)
A "state" is not an abstract condition.

A "state" is a regime in which certain exposures dominate outcome.

For example:
- In a stable narrative state, time decay dominates.
- In a fracture-prone state, convexity dominates.
- In a policy-anchored state, volatility dominates.
- In a liquidity withdrawal state, correlation dominates.

States tell you which variables are behind the steering wheel, and which are in the back seat.

Positioning then, in the God's Eye sense, is not the act of choosing which risks you are willing to carry, but which you refuse to touch. Positioning is the pre-commitment to avoid exposures that can kill you before you are allowed to be right.

# STATE > EXPOSURE > POSITIONING
Most people evaluate positioning as such:
- Opinion > long / short > hope

God's Eye evaluates positioning as such:
- State assessment > exposure preference > mechanical positioning

If the current state suggests that:
- Direction is uncertain.
- Volatility is underpriced.
- Timing risk is high.

Then any position that embeds:
- Large directional delta.
- Short convexity.
- Heavy time decay.

Is structurally misaligned, regardless of how "bullish" or "bearish" the thesis is.

God's Eye positioning would demand instead:
- Minimize delta.
- Maximize convexity.
- Limit time exposure.

Whether the underlying position appears long, short, or net neutral is irrelevant.

# SAME TRADE, DIFFERENT OUTCOMES
Two traders can be simultaneously long the same asset and be positioned in completely opposite ways.

One can be:
- Long delta.
- Short volatility.
- Short time.
- Leveraged.

While the other is:
- Long optionality.
- Long time.
- Bounded risk.
- Convex.

Both are operating under the assumption that the state will persist. States, however, are not forever. States shift, regimes break, and when they do, only one survives.

Direction did not matter so much as exposure did.

It is for this reason that you understand: positions must be described by **what kills them**, not by what they point to.

Good positions are not positions that make money in your base case. Good positions are ones that:
- Degrade slowly outside your base case.
- Pays aggressively when reality diverges from consensus.
- Does not require precision timing.

> It is good to note, however, that this does not automatically assume short-dated positions are inherently "bad," but just less aligned with this particular system.

It is for this reason that God's Eye tends to gravitate towards asymmetry, optionality, capped downside, and generally patience-heavy structures. It's not clever; it respects uncertainty.

Consider the following premise.

# STRUCTURING
It is mid-year. Inflation prints have come down materially, but not decisively. The FED has paused further rate hikes, yet continues to speak in conditional language. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ sit at near all-time highs. The VIX has sat range-bound between 13 ~ 6 for the better part of 3 months. Credit spreads are tight. Media consensus is that the "soft landing" is underway.

Average market participants look at this as "bullish."

God's Eye does not ask whether this environment is bullish or bearish. That question is premature.

We ask instead: **what state are we in?**

### 1. Identify the state
What is the current state of the market? The market is in a state of fragile equilibrium.
- Expectations are tightly clustered.
- Volatility is priced for continuation. The assumption is that "the state / regime" will persist.
- Directional consensus is strong. Everyone thinks "bullish, strong, only up."
- Policy is not resolved — only deferred.

Notice: there is nothing specifically wrong with the system yet, but the system is tense. The market is balanced on conditional promises.

This is not a pre-crash state.
This is not a trend state.
This is a compression state.

Think of a coiled spring.

### 2. Determine which exposures are mispriced.
In a compression state:
- Direction is uncertain.
- Timing is unknowable.
- Volatility is underpriced.
- Convexity is cheap.

The dominant factor at play is not direction, but convexity and underpriced volatility.

If the system holds, price drifts. If the system breaks, price gaps.

We can infer then: being right slowly pays little; being wrong quickly is fatal. This asymmetry alone invalidates most directional expressions.

We conclude:
- Heavy delta exposure is dangerous.
- Shorting volatility is committing account suicide.
- Theta (time decay) must be contained.
- Convexity is valuable, but most importantly, mispriced.

### 3. Eliminate weights.
Positions that do not respect this system state:
- Large, unhedged longs. Price gaps down, you die.
- Aggressive shorts. Price gaps up / price grinds, you die.
- High leveraged directional bets. You time it wrong, you die. You get direction wrong, you die.
- Anything that requires "nothing to happen." The system is fragile, if something — anything — happens, you die.

Remember: survive first, profit later.

### 4. Define exposures.
Given the fragile equilibrium state, the desired exposure is:
- Low net delta, because we don't know direction.
- Long convexity, because we want chaos / disorder to pay us.
- Minimum theta decay, because being early must not be fatal.
- Tolerance for drift, because the market may do nothing for longer than expected.

This is no longer abstract. This is precise exposure targeting.

### 5. Design positioning.
There are multiple instruments that can express this view. The exact choice is implementation preference, not philosophy. Note, the likely scenarios:
- If the market breaks, policy surprises, liquidity shocks, narrative fractures — convexity pays magnitudes.
- If the market drifts — losses are slow, controlled, survivable. You take timing out of the equation.
- if the market rallies — delta is muted, damage is limited. You're long gamma.

The position is not built to predict which outcome occurs, but to weight outcomes asymmetrically.

### 6. Assess.
Notice your shift in perspective and mindset.

You no longer ask: "Do I think the market will go up or down?"

You ask: "What state are we in? Fragile equilibrium? What happens if the market is right about itself? What happens if it's wrong?"

Remember the trademark of a fragile equilibrium:
- Expectations are tightly clustered.
- Volatility is priced for continuation. The assumption is that the state / regime will persist.
- Directional consensus is strong. Everyone thinks "bullish, strong, only up."
- Policy is not resolved — only deferred.

What happens if it's right? Slow, grind up. Continued relief rally. Delta pays modestly.

What happens if it's wrong? Overnight air pockets. Price gaps. Volatility expands. Gamma outperforms delta 10:1.

Which one is preferable, in your mind?

A position that is long convexity, low net delta, and survives drift, in this case, might look like:
- Long-dated straddle where strikes are far enough out that drift does not kill you, but any regime break reprices volatility violently, and gamma ramp nets you multiples.
- A debit call spread paired with a put, where upside gain is capped deliberately in exchange for financing downside convexity.
- A calendar spread, long back-month volatility and short near-term premium, betting explicitly that the timing of the break is unknown, but the mispricing of volatility itself is structural.

These are not recommendations, but exposure archetypes. Many implementations can express the same intent.

In all cases, the common thread is not direction, but architecture: limited loss if nothing happens, asymmetric gains if the state fractures.

# ASSUMING FAILURE
What if, despite positioning, we're still wrong?

That's fine.

Correct thinking does not immunize you from adverse paths.

Correct thinking does not make you infallible.

Throughout your trading or investing career, you will see the best structured, most airtight trades crumble. You will see the sloppiest, nonsense trades net multiples.

In our case:
- Volatility stays suppressed longer than the position / solvency allows.
- Back-month volatility never reprices.
- Correlation breaks the wrong way.
- Liquidity vanishes when you need to adjust / roll.
- The regime break isn't as violent.

What do we do, then? We size properly.

We remember what risk is to God's Eye.

Sizing, duration, and patience are not optional add-ons. They are part of positioning.

# ONE CAVEAT
If your position requires the market to cooperate on timing, you are not positioned — you are gambling. Is gambling bad? Not necessarily. Gambling is simply exposure that requires cooperation from the markets; positioning is exposure that survives refusal. There are good gambles, and there are bad gambles.

Your task is to, at times, discern the two.

# CONCLUDING
A correct position is not one that predicts the future accurately, but one that remains coherent when the future refuses to cooperate. God's eye does not seek certainty — it seeks structures that survive it.

Next: asymmetry.
