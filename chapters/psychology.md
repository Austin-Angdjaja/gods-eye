# EMBRACE THE SUCK
The market demands a certain psychology from all its participants — particularly, the ability to tolerate drawdowns and sit through discomfort. When you first establish a position, it is unrealistic to expect instant profits without first suffering some level of drawdown. To do so would be tantamount to calling exact tops and bottoms — right down to exact ticks, even. In other words, not possible.

It is imperative you understand:
- Drawdowns are the norm.
- Losses are standard.
- Red is the market's favourite colour.

It is not the losses or the drawdowns themselves that are important. It is how you manage them that matters.

# DRAWDOWNS AND MORE
The market may remain irrational longer than you may remain solvent. It is delusional to expect instant repricing just because you have taken an otherwise logical position. It is delusional to expect the market to notice all the things you noticed, just because you noticed it first. It is delusional to expect the market to move on your time, on your schedule, on your whim, just because you need it to. This is precisely why drawdowns are standard. This is precisely why you, as an operator, must grow to accept that losses (temporary or paper ones, at least), are the norm. Does this prove your thesis wrong? No.

Au contraire.

The thesis breaks only when the thesis breaks. Price is not the thesis, and the thesis is not price. Remember that.

Just because an options position has turned from 0% to -40% to -80%, does not necessarily mean that the thesis is broken. The thesis may be fully intact whilst you remain fully underwater still.

Fun fact: it is very common for my positions to sit on -50% ~ -80% for weeks on end. The nature of God's Eye demands it. I have grown to accept that such losses are standard and the cost of admission for asymmetry. If I were to set a hard stop-limit and cut positions the moment any breaches pre-established levels, the entire system would implode. Stop losses and discontinuous systems do not go hand-in-hand; stop losses assume a continuous, linear system. God's Eye is everything but.

How is it that I am able to comfortably sit on -80%, then? No, the answer is not, "because I am a sociopath." The answer is, "because I anchor to thesis, not price."

My only task, as an operator of God's Eye, is to survive noise and left tail distribution until the right tail manifests. We do so by positioning, sizing, practicing capital stewardship, etc... all things this repository discussed and will continue to discuss. I have seen positions so deep in the red turn green overnight. I have seen dead positions come alive on a single headline. I have seen entire weeks’ worth of drawdown wiped out on a single, random Tuesday.

Some people would argue it is luck — luck that I have managed to survive for this long.

Yes, it does seem remarkably similar to luck from the outside perspective. I propose, however, an alternative viewpoint: the outcome may be distilled down to luck, true, but consider that luck itself requires you are positioned to benefit from its arrival.

Consider, that it is not luck that has saved me thus far.

Consider, that I have managed to survive noise and left tail distribution long enough for right tail outcomes to confirm my thesis.

Consider, that I survived because I specifically structured myself, so randomness and noise is physically incapable of killing me before it helps me.

This, of course, only works because most positions are, and I can't stress this enough, sized intentionally to be disposable, and because I accept that many will die quietly. I do not always win. As a matter of fact, I often lose.

Most systems are defined by how they lose. God's Eye is no different.

# PANIC SELLING
I'm not going to lie: drawdowns do suck. Losses do suck. Positions in the red are less than preferable. It is a common market misconception that to remain emotionless means to not feel anything. That is impossible. **Every** trader, investor, and market participant feels the sting of drawdowns. What differentiates the survivor from the unfortunate, is what they do with these feelings.

To state the obvious: don't risk what you can't afford to lose. Drawdowns that sting are normal. Drawdowns that put your account in terminal danger are not. Prior to opening a position, consider the "worst case" scenario. Consider also, said "worst case" scenario manifests, and you lose such and such amount of money. Is that acceptable? Is that within your risk tolerance? No? Size down. Repeat.

Is your new position size within your risk tolerance? Yes? Good.

You've eliminated panic selling as a reaction.

# ON HANDLING EMOTIONS
It is perfectly fine to feel the sting of drawdowns. It is perfectly fine to vent, to get upset, to feel frustrated and so. As a matter of fact, I'd go as far to say that such reactions are expected. What matters is you do not let these emotions interfere with your system. You do not let these emotions leak into your decision-making framework, into your rationale, into your logic, into your actions and such.

In other words: you must not let your emotions contaminate your decision making. So long as you do not — flip a table, why don't you?

# CONCLUDING
To be perfectly truthful: I cannot teach you psychology. As a matter of fact, I don't think anyone is capable of such feats. Psychology is individualistic, and how you think and feel and process emotions differs from how I do. This is precisely why a paper trader, who would otherwise perform remarkably well with a simulated account, would no sooner implode in a live environment. The brain can differentiate fake and real, and unfortunately, fake money carries no weight. It is only after having spent time in the market, and only after suffering losses, drawdowns, and even a wipe out or two, do you, as an individual and operator, begin developing the necessary psychology. All else follows.
