# MANDATES REIMAGINED

What is the purpose of bacteria? Most people would suggest, "to infect." 

They are partially correct. 

Bacteria infect, but infection is a byproduct of their true purpose, that is, to replicate — to make more of themselves.

Like bacteria, most people, party, or system can be distilled into mandates — or, more precisely — purposes governing their existence.

This chapter of God's Eye seeks to teach you how to identify mandates, and how to exploit them.

# BINDING VOW
In order to successfully identify mandates, one must observe not a system, person, or party's actions, but what purpose those actions serve. Let's start simple.

What is the purpose of a for-profit organization?

Simple — the purpose of a for-profit organization is to make money.

They do this by generating revenues, reducing costs, and translating said revenues into income. One could argue, "well, yes, but businesses also grow!" True, they do. With the newly generated income, businesses may pursue expansion, growth, and thus, more revenue generating capabilities. Notice, however, growth is a byproduct of their mandate. Growth is subordinate to the mandate.

In this case, we can safely say that this hypothetical for-profit organization's mandate is: "to make money."

Therefore, anything that interferes with the organization's ability to make money is seen negatively.

Let's try an exercise.

Suppose the business is expected to decide on **one** particular course of action before tomorrow's open:
1. Greenlight their expansion into South-East Asia.
2. Accept a bank bailout offer to settle sizeable debt.
3. Retire their Founder-CEO, who has not been meeting expectations.
4. Discontinue an unprofitable product line.

Which of the four decisions is likely to be announced?

Think back to the businesses' mandate: to make money.

Which scenario is currently violating this mandate?

Well, consider:
- Action 2. implies that the business is insolvent and subjectable to chapter 11 bankruptcy.
- Action 3. implies that the Founder-CEO has been unable to perform.
- Action 4. implies that a product line is incurring loss, and producing net negative income.

Now, which scenario, should it be carried out to the logical conclusion, and absent of the businesses' intervention, **kills** the mandate?

Although an underperforming CEO and a bad product line are all problems, they are problems which still allow the business to function tomorrow, and thus carry out its mandate.

Being insolvent, however, is not a problem which leaves the business operational still.

Being insolvent means your business dies, and if the business dies, it cannot "make money."

It cannot carry out its mandate.

Do we conclude it a certainty then, that the business will accept a bank bailout offer to settle their sizeable debt? No. Think back to our earlier chapters: nothing is ever certain — not in markets and not in life. Being **certain** of something is the quickest way to zero'ing out your account. We can, however, infer that the probability favors Action 2. very much so.

When a mandate is threatened, all secondary concerns are abandoned. When survival is at stake, ideology, reputation, and promises become negotiable. Mandates are binding constraints, not preferences.

# CONFLICTING MANDATES
Our earlier example supposes an entity in vacuum. In reality, however, entities have varying mandates:
- CEO's: survival, compensation, personal reputation.
- Governments: stability, legitimacy, regime continuity.
- Funds: performance, capital retention, career risk.

Mandates **can** and often **will** conflict. Where they do, the dominant one wins.

This principle is exactly why states nationalize utilities. Letting a private company be the power responsible for providing your country with water is a recipe for disaster. What happens if tomorrow, that very same private company demands double rates? You're the government, yes, but absent nationalization, they hold the water. What do you do then?

The dominant mandate is not the one held by the strongest party.

The dominant mandate is the one that can survive the longest under adverse conditions.

# IDENTIFYING MANDATES
The problem, of course, is that most of the time, mandates are invisible. Absent stress or potential system collapse, the true intention / purpose of an entity can only be somewhat inferred.

In other words: mandates only become visible when time removes optionality. Before that, actors can wait, but after, they must act.

Let me ask:
> "What is the Islamic Iranian Regime's mandate?"

Is the purpose of the Islamic Iranian Regime to govern Iran? Is the purpose of the Islamic Iranian Regime to maintain control over the populace? Is the purpose of the Islamic Iranian Regime to grow and project power in the region?

Don't look at the **what**, look at the **why**.

Remember: actions serve mandates, **always**.

It's true — the Islamic Iranian Regime governs Iran, and maintains control over their populace, and, to a certain extent, seeks to grow and project power in the region. But why do they pursue these course of actions?

Because, at its core, the Islamic Iranian Regime's mandate is simple: to guarantee continuity.

Governing Iran places them in a seat of power, hand on the steering wheel. Maintaining control over the populace (keyword: control), prevents riots, protests, and opposition. Projecting power in the region crushes any sovereign forces from attempting to overthrow the current clerical rule via influence or force.

The Islamic Iranian Regime exists only to guarantee the future of the Islamic Iranian Regime.

# WEAPONIZING MANDATES
And so the question must be answered: how do you weaponize mandates? How do you monetize them? 

First thing you must know:
> "Markets are mandate-resolution engines. Price is a residual of mandates colliding under time pressure."

Mandates explain why:
- CEOs dump stocks.
- Governments bail out banks.
- Funds puke positions at lows.
- Volatility clusters.

These are not random sentiments. These are mandates hitting constraints.

Let's examine some theoretical examples:
> Second quarter rolls around.
>
> Corvyd Collective Co. is sitting 8% down YTD.
>
> Peers are down some 2% YTD.
>
> SEC filings reveal a majority of Corvyd's holdings are in volatile, unpopular positions.
>
> November rolls around.
>
> What do you do?

Mandate, first — what is it? A funds' mandate is to perform as well or better than peers. A funds' mandate is to retain capital. A funds' mandate is, above all, to avoid career risk. Underperforming is career risk. Performance is judged quarterly, and to a certain extent, annually.

What happens if they're right in six months, and the position swings violently green? Doesn't matter.

What happens if they're wrong by December 31? Investors see them performing 4x worse than peers, see them **still** holding onto bleeding positions, see them unable to stabilize, and begins asking why said fund is refusing to de-risk. Perceptions change.

This scenario ends with that fund tanking.

Underperformance > capital flight > career risk > forced action to maintain mandate.

So what does the fund do?

Or, more precisely, what **can** the fund do?

They liquidate, not because the thesis broke — but because they ran out of time. And how does this manifest in markets? They hit the ejector seat.
- Forced selling into weakness.
- Correlations jump to 1.
- Liquidity evaporates.

You don't short stocks Corvyd is holding because the underlying company is bad. You short those positions because, regardless of price, you know someone must sell. Some example trade implementation for this scenario:
- Net short delta.
- Defined tail risk.
- Limited theta bleed.
- Balanced convexity exposure.

The edge here then isn't direction. It's knowing how a market mover **must** act.

In '08, many thought that it was indeed the end of capitalism — that all the banks were indeed going to go under and stay that way. Few thought to think that governments wouldn't dare let that happen. To get to that conclusion, however, one must ask "why?" Why is it that governments **could not** have let that happen? Why is it that a national bailout **must** happen?

It's not that the government was acting in the interest of shareholders.

It's that the government was acting to preserve the system.

It's that the government was maintaining their mandate.

# CONCLUDING
It is important you understand what a mandate is, because all of God's Eye builds upon this very concept. Markets do not reward intelligence or conviction. It rewards correctly identifying who is forced to act and when.
