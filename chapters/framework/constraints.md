# COSTRAINTS AS CORE
And for the meat and bones of God's Eye, that which builds upon all previous concepts and introduces the core — constraints.

What is a constraint? Simply put, constraints are restrictions or limitations — be it personal, political, economical, or due to any number of other contributing factors.

A CEO can not easily embezzle company funds. Why? Legally, that would land them in jail. Personally, that would ruin their reputation. Logistically, they would require the cooperation of several company personnel, some of which may have an interest in becoming future whistleblowers. These are their constraints. It is not to say that CEOs can never embezzle funds, but there are hurdles and hoops to jump through, some harder than others, and some impossible.

Constraints in markets dictate what is "allowed" of an actor. The stronger the constraint, the more binding.

This is God's Eye's core input.

# PATH SYNTHESIS
I don't see the market as just prices and ticker symbols, and you shouldn't either — not for the purpose of God's Eye, at least. I'd like, instead, for you to picture the market as an aggregate prediction of all future paths — a distribution, if you may. TSMC, for instance, is not priced as just, "the only company in the world that can make the most advanced chips." The chance of China invading Taiwan and possibly seizing TSMC is also priced into the stock. So is the chance of the company being overtaken — being rendered obsolete by a competitor's breakthrough. So is the chance of chip demand declining. So is the chance of Taiwan sinking.

Although the probability those events manifest is, to be frank, miniscule, those "possible futures" are still priced into the stock regardless.

The thing is — the market is horrible at path synthesis.

It might be a beast at arbitraging away micro-inconsistencies and sniping mispriced orders, but its ability to understand context, second-order events, left and right tail distribution, is still horrendous.

It is the sole reason God's Eye is able to — and will continue to — exploit opportunities.

So, again, I urge you to adopt this new way of thinking.

Instead of prices and ticker symbols.

Think possible futures and plausible paths.

# ALLS TOMORROW
We've established already that the market is constantly pricing in all possible futures and events, and assigning probabilities. Again, God's Eye asserts that these probabilities are much less probabilities and more so just glorified "guesses." It is the sole reason tail distribution outcomes, when manifest, pay so asymmetrically. The market constantly prices these outcomes as "things that will **almost** never happen." The problem, of course, is determining what exactly constitutes "things that **almost** never happen," and, if whether the market is indeed correctly assigning odds.

When we perceive an event or a situation, it is easy to think of **all** the different paths the future may take. It is, however, much harder to imagine only the **plausible** futures.

Why is this important?

Remember: the market prices in **all** possible futures.

It can then be reasoned, if we are able to eliminate **some** — or better yet **most** — possible futures, that we can pinpoint the few paths where reality likely converges, and thus front-run reality itself. It is the act of deciding what is realistically plausible, and theoretically plausible. The distinction kills.

Case study: Will China invade Taiwan before 01/01/2027?

Theoretically? Sure. China possesses the military capacity to take Taiwan via conventional warfare, or protracted blockades, or economic pressure. Will they, however, is a completely different question. It is best to note — just because an actor possesses the capacity, does not mean they possess the capability.

China could take Taiwan, however, to do so would lead to such devastating consequences that it would render the invasion moot. Consider:
- Taiwan has TSMC.
- TSMC is a global pillar of the international AI economy.
- In the event defeat is imminent for Taiwan, TSMC will render all facilities inoperable.

Consider also, the likely fallout scenario:
- TSMC operations disrupted.
- Global AI supply chain collapses.
- Global AI economy collapses.
- Recession sets in.
- China adversely affected due to export-based economy.

This is not considering yet the international pressure Beijing will face should they pursue such course of action. The U.S. would respond with military intervention, and an international coalition aligned against China is likely to form. The consequences of taking Taiwan then materially threaten China and the CCP's continuity to such a degree that although Beijing possesses the capacity to take Taiwan, they do not possess the capability to do so.

Notice the distinction.

To possess a weapon does not mean to wield one free of consequence.

# MARKET IMPLICATIONS
How exactly does this aid us in markets? Previously, we established:
- Actors are governed by mandates.
- Mandates are rational.
- And constraints make mandates.

Our task then, distilled, is to answer the following:
> "Under this specific scenario, regarding this specific actor, and this specific actor's mandate, which course of actions are likely / unlikely?"

Mind you, an actor is not restricted to person(s).

An actor may be a state, an organization, a party, a system, or anything with mandates present.

Let's try a hypothetical:
> 21/1/2026 (INDONESIA, JAKARTA) - The Indonesian government has recently decreed that, to bolster domestic capabilities and industry development, exports are now restricted to a quota system, whereby 1 unit of product exported must be met by an equivalent 1 unit of product sold domestically. This new export regime applies to all Indonesian sectors and industries equally.

Although perhaps exaggerated, such scenarios do arise in markets from time to time, and our task as operators is to make opportunity of chaos — to discern the trade.

How do we begin to tackle something as complex as this?

You dissect the problem, and start by asking the most important question: "Is this real, and is this binding?"

Binding decisions are decisions that can not as easily be undone, or to undo said decision requires inflicting substantial pain to the actor and its / their mandate.

For instance — the Trump administration's tariffs are not binding. They are — and **have** — been done and undone in a matter of days to weeks.

An example of a more binding decision would perhaps be a law or decree being signed into a bill. This requires substantially more effort and energy — not to mention political risk — to undo.

Once you discern whether the Indonesian export regime is:
1. Real.
2. And binding.

You can start to assess the actor itself / themself.

The Indonesian government will effectively half all exports, and therefore half export revenue to all industries, sectors, and businesses.

Second-order thinking kicks in here.

What is the Indonesian government's mandate? Control, continuity, stability, and to a certain extent, development.

How popular do you think this bill will be?

Certainly not very popular, considering the government just wiped -50% export revenue from every single business in Indonesia.

What will happen after?

Businesses will protest, yes.

Those that can eat the export loss will eat the export loss.

Those that can't will die.

Entire industries and sectors will suffer.

Seeing the damage, and the unintended consequence to their own economy, what do you think will be the response of the Indonesian government?
- Nothing.
- Roll back the bill.

Doing nothing continues the damage.

Rolling back the bill will undo a great deal of the damage, and allows for recovery.

So now we have our most likely path:
- Bill goes into effect.
- Business, industries, and sectors suffer.
- Indonesian government observes the damage and correctly assesses that the bill is doing more harm than good.
- Indonesian government rolls back bill.

The reason this is our most likely path is because any other path that does not involve a rolling back of the bill will end in either:
- Mass riots born from populace unrest. (Businesses close down, jobs disappear).
- Major businesses relocating. (Export revenue and tax income lost).
- Loss of government legitimacy. (Population sees the government as unfit and not acting in their best interest).

All things that materially threaten the Indonesian government's mandate.

Conclusion — the most probable path is identified:
> Bill goes into effect > damage to economy > damage to economy identified > bill identified as cause > bill rolled back.

The thing is, the market is slow to price this.

The market is currently still on:
> Bill goes into effect > damage to economy.

The market is still pricing in imaginary paths:
- The government doubles down.
- The government endures.
- The government reframes it as nationalism.
- The government is able to subsidize losses indefinitely.

Some paths exist only on paper. They are priced because they are conceivable, not because they are survivable, and when markets price too many futures, they dilute conviction and create opportunity.

So, what now?

The index is still down massively, and major businesses' stocks in the Indonesian exchange are still trading at lows. The market has yet to realize that the **only** viable path the government can now take is a complete rollback, and is pricing in the possibility that the bill is binding and therefore permanent. The market is still pricing in alternate histories that **can not** realistically manifest.

We know, however, that if the Indonesian government **does not** roll back the bill, this damages and materially threatens their mandate. All other paths destroy the actor's mandate faster than a rollback. Consider:
- Loss of legitimacy. (Slow burn).
- Populace unrest. (Slow burn).
- Capital flight. (Medium burn).
- Elite fracture / infighting. (Fast burn).
- Military disobedience. (Instant death).

If we were put in this situation, then, we are able to take advantage of the extremely depressed stock prices and go about bargain hunting. In other words, "buy the dip."

The trade is not about being early.

The trade is about being **early to inevitability**.

God's Eye hunts for inevitability and asymmetry in one.

What is the constraint in this case, then?

The constraint is: if the Indonesian government wants to survive, there is only **one** plausible path to take.

The markets do not know this yet.

You do, now.

# ACCOUNTING FOR TIMING
The more damaging an issue is to a particular actor's mandate, the faster the rope burns. In essence, when extinction is a material threat, you act decisively and you act now. In ancient times, a rustling in the bushes may mean a lion. You don't wait to find out what exactly is in the bush, because waiting may mean the difference between living and dying. Your fight-or-flight instincts kick in, and you make for the hills.

Actors and mandates act very much the same way. The more material the threat of extinction, the more drastic the measure taken, and the faster the reaction.

Although we do not know exactly **when** the Indonesian government will roll the bill back, we are almost certain that the bill itself will be rolled back eventually. The mistake people make is structuring their trade to capitalize on the bill rollback itself. This is incorrect.

You structure your trade to survive **until** inevitability manifests — **until** the bill rollback happens.

Exercise judgement.

In the case of God's Eye, I am almost always early to trades. I am almost never on time, and most definitely never late. The reason for this is because, when reality finally converges and all possible futures collapse into a single path, the markets do not re-rate. They gap, and gap hard.

A bulk of the move is in the shock, not the follow up.

You want to be positioned before the shock.

This nature of God's Eye is also why you will spend days, weeks, months in waiting. The P/L curve is not linear — it is long periods of nothing punctuated by violent jumps.

# ACCOUNTING FOR MANDATE SHIFTS
In a crisis, actors will sometimes shift mandates. A government's mandate is typically growth, prosperity, continuity and legitimacy, yes, but in a crisis, that may change:
- From growth to control.
- From prosperity to ideological purity.
- From legitimacy to repression.

Case in point: North Korea, Mao, Pol Pot, dictators overestimating capabilities and committing to extinction, etc...

It is important you remember that whilst mandates are binding and actors are rational, unprecedented paths are born in times of crisis and chaos. You will occasionally enter trades where the planets align, and yet still lose because the actor in question pursues what is seemingly an irrational path.

Remember: risk and ruin, sizing and positioning.

Survive the anomaly.

# CONCLUDING
We all have constraints, in life and in markets. To understand constraints is to understand what the actor realistically can and can not sustain, and to understand one's limitations is to understand their choices, and to understand their choices is to understand their futures.

This is how God's Eye is able to frontrun reality itself — by discerning the future from fantasy.
