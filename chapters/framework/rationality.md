# RATIONALITY AS SURVIVAL
Self preservation is defined as the protection of oneself from harm or death, and is especially regarded as a basic instinct in human beings and animals. This very instinct is what instills a sense of fear when encountering a potentially dangerous or even life-threatening event.

Similarly, most systems in nature exist with an embedded sense of self preservation.

Actors, parties, and entities alike.

Whilst individuals and persons may be prone to moments of irrationality or mania, systems do not suffer the same fate. It is misleading to label an actor, party, entity, or system as irrational simply because we do not share values, nor understand motives at play. What may seem like irrationality to us, may very well be rationality when viewed through different perspectives.

# RATIONALITY AS BASELINE
A much more recent example: the current U.S. administration. Most people would call the Trump administration and its actions irrational, or downright manic; I disagree. Although the course of actions undertaken and the executive orders issued may be unconventional, wreckless, or downright detrimental in the long run, they are in no way random. They are in no way, irrational. Irrationality implies action without logic or reason, and as we've previously discussed — reasons can be deduced from mandates.

Rationality is a baseline.

Rationality does not mean optimal outcomes. It means internally consistent actions under given mandates and constraints.

Systems in nature and systems in an environment do not survive, let alone thrive, by being irrational and arbitrary.

Let's examine a case: the Maduro capture.

Question: was the Maduro capture an irrational or rational U.S. decision? The U.S. conducted a special operations within the land and air space of a sovereign nation, risking casualties, risking international backlash, risking escalation, and risking civilian death, all to remove the dictator of a Latin American country. Is this course of action worthwhile? Is this course of action worth the risk?

Most people would say no.

I'd argue otherwise.

In market terms, this is one of the most asymmetric trades I have ever seen live.

Let me explain.

Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, except there's just one problem: their oil is terrible.

Not bad.

Not less than good.

Terrible.

For starters, here's just some of the problem with Venezuela's oil:
- Venezuela has some of the heaviest, sourest oil. For those not versed in oil terminology, heavy + sour is the worst possible classification of oil, contrasted by light + sweet.
- Venezuela's oil is particularly **thick**, which means transport by pipeline requires a diluent.
- Venezuela's oil is highly impure, rich in sulfur and metals like vanadium and nickel. These impurities corrode equipment over time, poison catalysts in refineries, and force extra refining.
- Venezuela's oil requires blending with lighter hydrocarbons.
- Decades of sanctions, neglect, and underinvestment by the PDVSA has left oil infrastructure decayed.
- Majority of global refineries are optimized for light + medium refining, not heavy + sour.

Mind you, every single point on that list eats into capital, time, and manpower, thus reducing the net net for a barrel sold. 

"What does this have to do with Maduro?" you ask?

Maduro was vehemently anti Washington.

His opposition however, is not.

If you happen to be a world superpower, and you happen to remove Maduro from the equation, and you just happen to be just across the gulf, suddenly you gain access to the world's largest oil reserve overnight. In essence, the U.S. risked possibly some condemnations, possibly some international backlash, and some possibly casualties, to score one-fifth of the world's oil supply.

"But wait, you said that Venezuela's oil is trash, right? Oil infrastructure in Venezuela doesn't just get built up overnight! It'll take them years to fix up all that old equipment, and even then, because their oil is so bad, and they have to do so much to make it globally "ok," they won't make much profit after anyway."

Bravo, you, thinking one step ahead of me.

Except you've missed the point completely.

The U.S. didn't remove Maduro for Venezuela's oil.

They removed Maduro so that years down the line, when all that oil infrastructure is functional, when Venezuelan oil is flowing through U.S. pipelines, and when 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves lies in Washington's hands, they can give the big old middle finger to OPEC+.

And suddenly, that's one less counterbalance to the United States.

Suddenly, the U.S. acquires an option on future supply dominance.

Now, it all seems **very** rational, doesn't it?

I'd go even further to say, it's consistent with the U.S. mandate — with the mandate of a world superpower, no?

# CONCLUDING
You may have noticed this chapter is more philosophical than mechanical. That's the point. Too often have I met people who claimed irrationality in otherwise rational systems. This exact "jumping to the conclusion" is what blinds them, and keeps them from assessing the situation further. After all, saying "they're just irrational" is far easier than analysis. It is imperative you understand that irrationality is simply model incompleteness. Apparent irrationality is evidence of an incomplete payoff model, not the absence of rationality.

This is another core of God's Eye's: rationality is consistent, and consistency is predictable.
