# THE PROBLEM OF TIME
There is this sickly notion that timing the market is impossible. Usually, when people refer to "timing the market," they refer to timing the exact top or exact bottom. If market timing is indeed just calling tops / bottoms, then, by all means, I agree — it boils down to luck.

God's Eye, however, offers an alternative perspective into "market timing" — something I find much more tangible.

# SOME GUESS WORK
Some catalysts that spur violent re-ratings have set dates and is public knowledge. Biopharma stocks, for instance, live and die on their phase trial results. These trial results land on a single date, and this date is announced / publicly known beforehand. 

There is 0 timing problem associated here.

There is, however, an expectation problem.

If the stock is expected to exhibit violent behavior on a given day, then option prices adjust accordingly. Volatility spikes, premium spikes, and you are at risk of IV crush. This is one reason why betting on earnings isn't purely directional. You might be positioned right, but if the move itself isn't as violent as markets expect, you still lose.

In this case, there is 0 timing risk involved, but elevated expectation risk.

Since the market knows, it charges more.

But conversely, if the market can't know for sure, then it can't charge a premium. You've caught the market off guard. This applies to catalysts or developments that don't have a publicly set date, and some guess work is involved.

Take the following hypothetical:
> Intel CEO says Foundry customer expected to be announced at H2 2026.

And break it down to the facts:
- Foundry customer = a positive catalyst, very good for Intel.
- Stock price expected to gap up upon announcement.
- Announcement expected sometime during H2 2026.
- H2 2026 = June ~ December.

Also consider:
- There may be foundry customers.
- There may be no foundry customers.

This situation is one where the catalyst does not have a set date. You don't know exactly when Intel intends to announce their newly acquired foundry customer (if they indeed have one); you have only an idea. The market as well has only an idea, and since there is no set date, you aren't subjected to elevated IV and thus subsequent IV crush.

The problem, of course, is the timing, then.

You must structure your trade so that:
- You do not bleed out.
- You are pre-positioned **before** the announcement.
- You have full exposure during the expected timeframe / window.

The timing in this case isn't so much calling the top / bottom, it's "being positioned beforehand," and this is what timing is to God's Eye.

# THE PROBLEM OF THETA
Theta can be viewed as "how much the market charges for you to hold this trade." Every day you sit on a position, you pay Mr. Market a fee. The further out your expiry, the less Mr. Market charges you on a per day basis. In the case of our Intel hypothetical, what is our expected time frame?

Second half of 2026, which means June to December.

That's six months, 180 days — give or take.

You'd ideally then want full exposure to this 180 days, but want minimal exposure to the theta bleed associated. You can accomplish this any number of ways. You could, for instance:
- Purchase options expiring 180 days out and simply let the position sit until expiry.
- Purchase options expiring 220 days out and roll when expiry ticks down to < 100 days.
- Purchase options expiring 90 days out and re-purchase if catalysts do not manifest in the first 90 days.

Specific architecture is not the issue; structuring the trade so that bleed is capped is. You want max convexity, minimal theta decay, and full exposure to the event window. How you do so is personal preference at best.

# THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTION
"Sometime H2 2026" does not mean "there is equal chance every day, starting June 1st and ending December 31st, for the catalyst to manifest." There are periods of greater certainty, and periods of maximum uncertainty.

Companies, for instance, have a mandated "quiet" period before earnings announcements. A quiet period is a regulated timeframe where companies restrict communication to investors and the general public a few weeks before earnings, and no additional forecasts or new "business wins" may be declared.

If Intel reports Q3 and Q4 earnings during the H2 2026 window, then the distribution shrinks from 180 days, to something like 120 days (a few weeks estimated to be ~ 21 days, and two earnings quarters amounts to 2 quiet periods). Furthermore, companies are more likely to announce business partnerships, deals, updates, and developments on earnings calls. This also shifts the probability from "equally distributed every day of H2 2026," to "a few days carry starkly more weight." The few days in this context might refer to the two quarterly reports due on H2 2026.

Language matters as well.

If Intel really **does** have no customers for foundry, then why would management bother saying, "foundry customers to be announced at H2 2026." Intel is a massive company with hundreds-billions in market cap. They are no small-cap. The reputation of this giant lies in management's trust. It would be safe to conclude then that management would not "hype" their stock without substantial evidence to back their claims. Does this mean that Intel definitely has foundry customers? Not 100%, no, but we can conclude it's most probable.

We can then assert that as H2 2026 ticks closer to the end, the probability of the announcement arriving grows. The market expects an announcement before 2026 ends, so every day without an announcement is another day where the probability grows. This, however, assumes the survival of required preconditions under shrinking time.

For instance, when:
- Intel **needs** to prove credibility.
- Management silence becomes reputational risk.
- Language tightens ("we expect" > "we will").
- Timelines narrow.
- Third parties corroborate rumors.
- Milestones update.
- Etc...

The distribution collapses from "maybe," to "probably."

There are always clues in the market, and clues can be deduced to surmise the future. The onus is on us to find them.

# THE PROBLEM OF SIGNALS
There is also another approach rather than simply waiting out the entire H2 2026 period. Right now, our timing logic is something like:
> Time passes > probability increases.

However, consider an alternative:
> Expected signals arrive on schedule > probability compresses.
>
> Expected signals fail to materialize on schedule > probability collapses.

If Q3 earnings arrive for instance, and:
- No tightening language.
- No customer-side leaks.
- No subsidy alignment.
- No follow-ups.
- No capex spending hints.
- No analyst follow-ups.

Probability collapses, not compresses.

In the world of business, silence is not silence. Silence is communication. Silence is only bullish when silence is expensive.

At this stage, you have two choices to make, and two ways to structure the trade:
- Wait out the rest of the H2 2026 time frame.
- Assess that probability has not compressed, decide bleeding out isn't worth the potential catalyst, and cut. 

The catalyst may manifest in Q4 without any added clues from Q3, or it may not and the clues were right. There is simply no knowing ahead of time.

Think of the earnings reports in this case as a checkpoint. If Intel says "H2 2026," and:
- Q3 comes with nothing.
- Q4 comes with conditional, hedged language.
- The stock stops reacting to foundry headlines.

Then the market isn't waiting, anymore. The market has quietly repriced probability of the catalyst manifesting to near zero.

Is it still worth it to hold?

Is it still worth it to keep paying theta?

Do you still trust management?

Notice the shift.

Probability has collapsed.

# AND THE PROBLEM OF FEASIBILITY DECAY
The question is binary. "Will Intel announce foundry customers by H2 2026?"

That's a yes or a no.

The outcome may be binary, but the belief about the outcome is not.

The mistake most people make is assuming because the payoff is binary, the path to expiry does not matter.

It does.

Let's take this to the logical conclusion. If Intel **will** announce a foundry customer in H2 2026, then:
- There exists an information trail leading up to it.
- Certain things must hold true **before** the announcement.
- Silence is not neutral. It is conditional.

For instance:
- Contracts between Intel and their prospective partners have to be signed.
- Fabs must be allocated.
- Customers must align capex.
- Intel must align capex.
- Regulators / subsidies must be cleared.
- Counterparties must prepare disclosures.

All these leak structure, if not entire headlines. For binary events, the absence of expected preconditions is itself information. This is logic necessity.

We are essentially betting on: "Intel has at least one foundry customer contract in force by H2 2026."

For that to be true, the following must hold true by certain times:
- Intel has allocated fab capacity.
- Customer-side capex plans reflect usage.
- Subsidy language aligns with third-party demands.
- Legal / regulatory groundwork is done.
- Management tightening language.

If none of these preconditions manifest by Q3 earnings, then one of two things is true:
- The catalyst is delayed beyond H2 2026.
- The catalyst does not exist.

Either way, the trade thesis is violated or massively weakened, even though it may not have fully resolved.

You are now essentially paying theta to express a trade with substantially less probability of manifesting.

# CONCLUDING
Timing is not exposure to time, per se; timing is exposure to belief updates. This chapter sounds and feels very wishy-washy because timing is, in fact, nothing concrete. There is no way to perfectly time the drop of a catalyst, nor is there any way to tell whether said catalyst will manifest at all. Timing, in the God's Eye sense, is not the act of calling tops or bottoms, but the act of assessing changes of time distribution.
