# POSITIONING AND DEPOSITIONING
There are always objectives in war. An objective may be something as simple as, "take out the enemy convoy," to something as convoluted as, "replace the current regime with a puppet government." Every mission has an end, and it is this very end that defines the parameters.

If positioning is the act of entry, depositioning is the act of exit. A trade without clearly defined exits and invalidations is essentially no different than "hoping for the best." That will not suffice. Hope does nothing good for you in markets.

# UPON ENTRY
Every entry is supported by a thesis, and it is this very thesis that defines the parameters of the trade:
- How big the position.
- How long the timeframe.
- Architecture and structure.
- What to tolerate.
- What to expect.
- When to hedge.
- Etc...

It is imperative you do not shift the goal post. When you enter a trade, you enter a trade for a specific reason. You do not simply see developments in the field and think, "well, maybe XYZ can still happen" or so and so. There must be a singular reason the position exists in your portfolio, and so long as that reason holds, you hold.

# AND UPON EXIT
Conversely, once the reason you entered the trade no longer applies, or the thesis has been invalidated, you leave. There is no use sticking around. Once the circumstances have changed enough, to the point you are comfortably declaring, "the reason I entered this trade no longer applies," cut and cut immediately.

The reason there has to be a set "exit condition" is because we, as humans, are pre-conditioned with psychology that runs counter to what is optimal in markets. The sunk-cost fallacy, for instance, keeps us in positions that we know as a fact, are dead. It's the feeling of, "Well, I'm already down -80%, there's only $200 left in the position. Might as well let it ride, right?"

More often than not, of course, that -80% turns to -100% and that $200 turns to $0. You were right, and you've effectively thrown out $200 — free money that could otherwise be sitting in your account.

Let me pose a question: if you see $200 on the ground, will you pick it up?

Of course you would. Everyone would.

So why don't you, in markets?

Capital freed from a dead or completed trade is not idle — it is ammunition for future opportunity.

Depositioning doesn't just apply to positions that are down. Depositioning applies to positions that are up.

Once the objective has been reached, you cut and cut immediately.

You close the position without reassessment, resizing, or narrative adjustment.

For instance, if you're betting that Freeport-McMoran's mine closure in Indonesia is way overblown by markets, and you're expecting a mean-reversion to pre-catalyst levels, then once the price **does** indeed return to pre-catalyst levels, you leave. You take your winnings and you leave. You don't stick around to see, "well, maybe Freeport will run a little bit more," or "actually, I'm starting to like the stock; I think I'll stick around."

You assess that the mission has been accomplished, and you exfiltrate.

# AND UPON TIME
Time is the third killer.

Most people see trades as "I'm right," or "I'm wrong." Seldom do people consider, "I was right on objective, but wrong on timing." A thesis that remains theoretically valid but fails to manifest within your expected timeframe is also invalidated. Let me elaborate.

My usual period for options holding is 220dte ~ 260dte (days-to-expiry).

220 days gives me enough time to see catalysts manifest without bleeding out to theta. Once the holding period gets to 100 days, however, theta ramp starts kicking in. If I do not see progress by then, even if the thesis still holds, I cut and re-assess. I am not willing to sit on a bleeding position hoping to see developments; I will, however, exit and consider if the timeline requires adjusting. 

The reason for this is because stagnant trades kill. Markets bleed people out who are correct all the time.

An invalidation is framed as:
- Thesis broken.
- Objective reached.

Consider, as well, an invalidation may be:
- Time without progress.

Define your time horizon in advance, and obey.

# CONCLUDING
More importantly than entries, perhaps, are exits. Trades don't often die on entries, but on exits. It all boils down to thesis invalidation / completion. Once the thesis has been invalidated, leave. Once the objective has been accomplished, leave. There is no negotiating with the exit.

Entry expresses conviction, exit enforces discipline. Without discipline, conviction is just ego.
