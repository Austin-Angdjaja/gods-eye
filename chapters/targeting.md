# PINPOINT ACCURACY
Do you know what the difference is between a butcher and a surgeon?

Precision.

The United States has always possessed the capability to turn a substantially large area into glass. What strategic bombers lack in pinpoint precision, they make up for in raw firepower. The problem, of course, is that oftentimes, more firepower is not the solution to every problem.

Some problems demand overwhelming force; others demand exacting precision.

Markets, like battlefields, reward those who can distinguish one from the other.

# WHAT IS TARGETING
In baseball, you have three strikes before you're out. In markets, you have infinite strikes. You will never be penalized for letting a trade / investment go. The most common mistake market participants make is thinking, "one big, good trade will set me up for life. If I miss this, that's my **one chance** gone."

A little personal advice from me to you: that thinking doesn't get you ahead, it kills you.

I've missed out on hundreds-% gains.

I've missed out on thousands-% gains.

I've even missed out on ten-thousands-% gains.

The key is to realize:
1. Opportunities are endless.
2. One big, good trade will **not** set you up for life.

Targeting, is in essence, stacking the odds to your liking.

You only ever trade / invest when either the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor, or the risk / reward payoff is so obscene that it warrants taking what can be reduced to a pure gamble. Consider:
1. 95% chance you win, 5% chance you lose. Winning nets you +3%, losing nets you -85%.
2. 75% chance you win, 25% chance you lose. Winning nets you +15%, losing nets you -80%.
3. 85% chance you win, 15% chance you lose. Winning nets you +5%, losing nets you -80%.
4. 5% chance you win, 95% chance you lose. Winning nets you +2500%, losing nets you -5%.

I presume you saw that and instantly gravitated towards trade 4. Why? Even though trade 4. has a 1 in 20 chance of hitting, in the off chance it **does** hit, you net 26x your money. The payoff being so disgustingly tilted makes taking that 5% gamble worth it every time over repeated exposure, given that you size and position properly. This is the right way of looking at markets.

You find asymmetry, and then you deploy.

# ASYMMETRY SIMPLIFIED
Symmetry implies that the upside matches the downside equally. Asymmetry implies that one distribution is skewed, which allows us to shift the standard of the game. You don't want to play a fair game with Mr. Market.

Most of the time, you don't want to play at all.

You play only when Mr. Market deals you such good draw, that not to play would be outright foolish.

So what is asymmetry? Asymmetry is when the odds of winning a trade are not 50/50, and the payoff isn't +100%/-100%.

Truth is, no trade / investment will ever be symmetric, but there are degrees of asymmetry that God's Eye specifically pursues.

What we want to do is **cheat.**

# ODDS
It is important we first determine the odds of winning a particular trade / investment. How you define winning is entirely personal, but it is important you anchor yourself to that objective. Next, we infer odds from information available. Let me demonstrate with a hypothetical:
> Ever since the DoD and DoE dropped Fahrenheit Mining Co., the company's business and stock has been in a downward spiral. They are unable to repay debts, and chapter 11 looks imminent. You wake up one day to find, however, that McKay's is in talks with Fahrenheit Mining Co.'s management in what looks to be a potential buyout / bailout. The century old bank is offering to essentially pay off the troubled junior miner's debt, in exchange for 51% equity. Details are sparse, and nothing yet has been confirmed. Management decision is expected before tomorrow's open.

Would you take this trade?

Before you answer, let's analyze:
- Junior miner with a debt problem.
- Bankruptcy imminent.
- Century-old bank offers a bailout.

Question, then: "What are the odds Fahrenheit Mining Co. refuses McKay's offer?"

Although we may never land on a specific figure, we can infer the probability.

Would you say it's a 50/50? Impossible. 50/50 would imply a coinflip, and this is no coinflip. You're smarter. Stay with me.

Would you say it's a 60/40? That could work. The alternative, if they refuse, is bankruptcy.

So is it a 70/30? Possibly. This is Fahrenheit Mining Co.'s last lifeline.

Or is it a 80/20? Could be as well. This looks less like a buyout, and more like a hostage situation.

The exact odds are irrelevant.

What is important is your gauge of the situation.

Is Fahrenheit Mining Co. more likely to accept, or more unlikely to accept?

How much more likely than unlikely, or conversely, how much more unlikely than likely?

Odds in markets are not computed — they are inferred from constraints, incentives, and survival dynamics (more on that later).

And once you ascertain — to any reasonable degree — the odds, analyze payoffs.

# PAYOFF
What is the expected payoff if Fahrenheit Mining Co. accepts McKay's offer? Well, suddenly, a stock that was once thought to be two months from declaring chapter 11, is back in business once more — and with **zero** debt. The stock rips like there's no tomorrow; re-rates by multiples, possibly.

What is the expected payoff if Fahrenheit Mining Co. declines McKay's offer? Well, that's the death knell, then. The stock plummets, erases whatever value it has left, and trades at single cents on the dollar until chapter 11 hits.

Payoff is:
- How much you potentially win.
- How much you potentially lose. 

# ODDS + PAYOFF = ASYMMETRY
That is the only equation you should consider when targeting any trade / investment. What are the odds you succeed? And if you do succeed, what is the payoff? Does the payoff compensate for the amount of risk taken?

In our earlier example, we can ascertain that it is far more likely than not that Fahrenheit Mining Co. would accept the offer. We can also ascertain that, in the event they do accept the offer, the payoff is reasonably big.

What do we call this kind of trade?

An asymmetric one. 

The odds are **not** 50/50.

The payoff is **not** +100%/-100%.

This exact asymmetry is God's Eye's natural leverage.

# TARGET FIRST, POSITION AFTER
It is important to note, however, that targeting and positioning are not the same.
- Targeting is deciding **when** asymmetry exists.
- Positioning is deciding **how** to express that view without dying.

Asymmetry without discipline degenerates into gambling; discipline without asymmetry degenerates into mediocrity.

Consider the following two examples.

# THE BUTCHER
Scenario:
> Large cap index (QQQ).
> FOMC just passed.
> Volatility was bid into the event, collapses immediately after.
> Directional uncertainty remains.
> Range compression highly likely.

Targeting logic:
- The risk event is gone.
- Market makers no longer need to overprice IV (convexity).
- Theta bleed is about to ramp.

Expression:
- Sell a defined-risk iron condor or call/put credit spread (monetizes range-bound behavior and volatility crush).
- Width chosen so max loss is tolerable (personal).
- Hold duration short (same day or next few trading sessions).

Why?
- Odds of nothing dramatic happening are high.
- Max loss is known and capped.
- Payoff is small, but probability-weighted expectancy is positive.

Translated: boring, repeatable, survivable. The **structure** itself is asymmetric, even though payoff is small.

# THE SURGEON
> Fahrenheit Mining Co.,
> Management's decision on bailout vote.
> Stock priced as if chapter 11 is imminent.

Targeting logic:
- Downside already priced near extinction.
- Upside is discontinuous. This is not a mean-reversion event. It is a gap event.
- Market structurally under-pricing volatility and gap risk.

Expression:
- Buy deep OTM calls.
- Size so loss is trivial if zeroed.
- Expectation is **not** to win often.

Why?
- 90% ~ 95% chance of full loss.
- The payoff for potentially hitting that 5% ~ 10% is upwards of 10x ~ 50x.
- Survival guaranteed by sizing.
- Dominance emerges through repeated exposure.

Translated: The **payoff** itself is asymmetric, even though the odds of losing dominate.

# CONCLUDING
The market is an adverserial environment. The problem people make is thinking that they can win by just playing Mr. Market's game well. I'm here to tell you: the best way to play is to only play hands where the deck is stacked so heavily in your favor that not playing would be irrational.
