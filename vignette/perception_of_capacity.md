# OF CAPACITY
In the God's Eye context, capacity is defined as any actor's "ability to do something." For instance, a politician may be judged for their capacity to make good on campaign promises. A fund may be judged for their capacity to generate excess market returns. A dictator may be judged for their capacity to supress populace dissent and instill dynasty rule.

# OF CAPABILITY
Capability is not to be confused for capacity, and vice versa. Capability is the immediate operational power, i.e. "can you execute this move, right now?" Capacity is the structural endurance that comes with said decision, i.e. "can you survive the consequences of this move?" Now consider a hypothetical: can China take Taiwan by force?
- Capability says so. China possesses the military means to seize Taiwan by force.
- Capacity says otherwise. Although China possesses the means to seize Taiwan by force, doing so would unleash a chain of events with such devastating consequences that to take the island-nation by force would result in permanent, terminal damage to the CCP.

It can then be reasoned that although China **can** theoretically take Taiwan by force, it will not (in an overwhelming amount of possible futures) do so because of the implications.

# AND OF DISCONNECT
The problem arises when an actor misjudges their capacity for capability. Historical accounts are rife with this exact mistake:
- Imperial Japan waging war on the United States via Pearl Harbor.
- Nazi Germany and Operation Barbarossa.
- FTX collapse.
- Argentina, Falklands War of 1982.
- Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
- Adam Neumann's WeWork collapse.
- Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan.

Now, consider the mismatch between capability and capacity in these specific instances:
- Imperial Japan could cripple the U.S. Pacific Fleet via surprise strikes. It had the elite naval aviation, operational surprise, and regional dominance to do so. Imperial Japan, however, lacked industrial depth and long-term shipbuilding parity with the United States. The U.S. industrial sector outproduced Japan multiple times over. Japan correctly assessed its short-term military capability, yes — however, the country catastrophically misjudged its capacity to win a prolonged industrial war against what is considered at the time, a vastly superior economy.
- The Wehrmacht was operationally superior to the Red Army, and Blitzkrieg alone had crushed all of France — to an extension, all of Europe. Nazi Germany, however, lacked logistical depth and severely underestimated the Russian winter. They severely overestimated their ability to achieve decisive victory before supply, weather, and manpower deteriorated.
- In theory, FTX could — and was indeed — operating a global exchange. The company, however, horribly misjudged solvency integrity and balance sheet durability under stress. Once withdrawal pressure mounted, FTX had no liquidity to absorb it.
- Argentina possessed the military means of seizing the Falklands Islands. It was achievable. They, however, lacked the geopolitical insulation and naval endurance to withstand a British counterattack backed by Western alliances.
- Iraq likewise possessed the military means to seize Kuwait, and they had. What the country did not possess, was the capacity to withstand an international, U.S.-led coalition response, coupled with global sanctions and prolonged aerial bombardment.
- WeWork touted global expansion, brand narrative dominance, and aggressive capital raising, all to fund the company's growth. The company, however, had no durable unit economics, massive lease liabilities, and no downturn resilience whatsoever. The narrative of growth masked how fragile the company truly was under Adam Neumann.
- The USSR invaded and took control of major Afghani cities, true. The USSR system, however, lacked economic resilience, political durability, and more sustainability to endure a prolonged fight against local insurgency backed by foreign funding.

# IN THE CASE OF THE CASES
By now, you perhaps could start to see a pattern develop. In all cases:
1. The actor correctly assessed what could be initiated.
2. The actor failed to model what was **actually** triggered.
3. The actor mispriced time.
4. The actor severely underestimated second-order effects.
5. The actor assumed opponents possessed less capacity than they did.
6. The actor modeled the opponent's immediate response, but not the opponent's endurance curve.

In all cases, the opening move — the capability — was optimized for and executed correctly. The capacity to sustain this move, however, was gravely underestimated, hence, long-term failure.

# AND IN THE CASE OF MARKETS
God's Eye handles mandates, actors, and rationality. The system is built to distill what is realistically possible from what is theoretically possible. It does so by assessing actors, mandates, rationale, and the capability / capacity of all parties involved.

You will find however, that occasionally, actors misjudge their own capability / capacity, and will commit to moves that would otherwise be nonsensical. Why? Because in the end, we are humans after all, and humans make mistakes, no matter the genius. When you stumble upon a particular action that may seem irrational on the actor's part, stop and consider — is it truly irrationality dominating said actor's decision, or have they simply misjudged capacity for capability?

Markets are full of actors who have:
- The capability to leverage up.
- The capability to suppress volatility.
- The capability to expand credit.

But not the capacity to absorb regime shifts.
- A hedge fund can lever 10x, but cannot survive a 5-sigma move.
- A central bank can suppress yields, but cannot suppress inflation indefinitely.
- A growth company can issue equity endlessly, but cannot issue credibility endlessly.

Capability in markets is oftentimes purchased through leverage. Capacity, however, is earned via resilience. Leverage increases capability, but reduces capacity. This tension is almost universal. Most catastrophic decisions in markets — and in life —  are not made by fools. They are made by actors who severely miscalculated survivability.
