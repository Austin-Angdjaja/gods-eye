# AUTHOR'S NOTE
Fault lines, I feel, didn't really belong in the chapters of basic market mechanics, nor do they belong strictly to God's Eye's decision making framework. Nevertheless, they are an important tool in my logic arsenal still, and deserve a place somewhere in this repository — hence, the vignette sub-category.

# CONTEXT
Google defines fault lines as: "a fracture or crack in the Earth's crust where two tectonic plates or blocks of rock meet and move against each other." In market terms, a fault line is neither geological nor tectonic. A fault line is, simply put, a place or time where event — and subsequently, repricing — is likely to occur.

That place may correspond with asset classes, specific companies, instruments, etc...

Why is this relevant, you ask? As traders and investors, there are two ways to look at the market: continuous and systemic, or discontinuous and jumpy. God's Eye leans hard towards the latter. Seldom do my positions benefit from slow drift upwards. Thus far, almost all of [Saffron Fields'](https://github.com/Austin-Angdjaja/saffron-fields) picks have benefited not from the market pricing in improving fundamentals, but from the market pricing in structural catalysts.

It stands to reason then, that our aim is not to side with the drift, but with the jump, and if we are able to identify specific moments, occurrences, or assets where a jump is most likely, we will have essentially front-run the entire market itself.

This revelation did not come to me in a dream.

This revelation came to me after having reviewed [Saffron Fields'](https://github.com/Austin-Angdjaja/saffron-fields) performance recently, and discovered that in 7/7 cases, every single core position established has gained anywhere between 50% ~ 400% within, at most, 2 months' time.

Was it luck? Of course.

To think that I am able to forecast catalysts coming is foolish.

Was it **just** luck? Not quite as well.

The catalyst was luck. The positioning was not.

# ON FAULT LINES
Think back to the days where Intel was trading at $20. Did it make much sense then — Intel trading at near book value? If you looked at the company from a purely fundamental and financial perspective, perhaps. Intel was a sunset company at the time, and management had somehow managed terrible decisions after terrible decisions, throwing away years of lead and paving way for competitors such as AMD.

What was the market pricing in?

The market was pricing in declining margins + failed foundry + product delays + management mis-step + non-zero chance of bankruptcy — in essence, maximum pessimism. The market was fully convinced, any day now, Intel would throw in the towel and shut down shop for good. The company had committed too many blunders to stabilize, and we were just watching the staircase down — the last days of the has been chip giant.

How does this tie back to fault lines? Notice: the downside had been fully monetized. Any worse and Intel trades at sub book value. Any further undesirable catalysts, and Intel may as well declare chapter 11.

If the market is pricing in maximum pessimism, and the reality wasn't maximum pessimism — say, perhaps just "bad, not terrible," then the upside is unbounded, and the downside is more or less capped. The situation then poses asymmetry. If Intel wasn't in as bad of a position as the market anticipated, a violent repricing upwards was in order, and if Intel was indeed in as bad of a position, then the downside has been priced in to begin with.

> Note: When I say, "the downside is more or less capped," I do not mean that the company has 0% chance of declining further. I mean that incremental bad outcomes no longer produce incremental repricing. Simply put, the market has begun discounting further "undesirable catalysts," because the market has reached a point of pricing in "all good, nothing good possible."

God's Eye looks for asymmetry where asymmetry is not obvious. Fault lines are one such "not-so-obvious" asymmetry, because the market — you and I included — will never know the objective truth to a company's situation until said situation has come to pass. In other words, we can not know what will happen until what will happen has happened. We can only infer.

Was the market's pricing of Intel fair, you think? Did it deserve to be priced as a soon-to-be bankrupt chip company? If your assessment comes to, "no, the market is overreacting here," then you have uncovered possible asymmetry, and possible asymmetry is easily monetizable.

# FINDING FAULTS
Earthquakes can not happen anywhere.

The same is true in markets. If you were to adopt this viewpoint and simply throw darts at the board randomly, your success may as well have depended on the roulette wheel. The key is to search for companies where despair is priced in. The key is to look for businesses with maximum embedded pessimism, and Mr. Market proudly proclaiming, "nothing good may come to this company — not now, not ever."

The logic is simple. If the market is expecting 100% downside, then 80% downside is not simply "less bad," it is "terrific" in this context. If the market is fully expecting bankruptcy, and the reality is simply dilution, even though dilution may be argued as subjectively "bad," the stock will still gap upwards anyway.

It is this dislocation between what the market believes, and the objective state of the company that presents us with magnificent opportunities.

Thus was the case with [Saffron Fields](https://github.com/Austin-Angdjaja/saffron-fields).

Thus is the case I hope for with [Saffron Fields](https://github.com/Austin-Angdjaja/saffron-fields) future.

# WHERE FAULTS MEET SURVIVAL
Most people would read and feel the sudden need to YOLO into a terminally insolvent company. I advise against that. Fault lines may only exist where survival is plausible. In order for fault lines to be monetized, the underlying company **must** be truly:
1. Priced at maximum pessimism.
2. Surviving.

Survival, in this case, extends to cash runway, no forced near-term refinancing agreements, no immediate binary kill-switch scenarios, etc... Survival first, then profit.
