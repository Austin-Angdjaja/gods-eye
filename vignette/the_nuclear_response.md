# RATIONALITY AS A BASE
All living beings are rationale at their base — us as well. We do not throw ourselves off a building for the same reason we do not point a realistic toy gun at police officers. In essence, the consequences of such actions pose an immediate threat to our survival, and survival instincts are ingrained in every fibre of our being. This rationality extends to decisions, no matter how grand the decision. Country leaders make decisions under assumed rationality as well, though that rationality may deviate due to culture, background, upbringins, societal norms, etc...

In the end, we make rational decisions because we are rational beings. This is a fact, and the fact stands.

# NUCLEAR RESPONSE
This rationality embeded in our being, however, ceases when extinction becomes the most probable path. For instance, consider the following hypothetical: would you gamble company funds on blackjack?

No, that would be absurd — not to mention a fragrant violation of the law.

Now consider another hypothetical: would you gamble the last bit of your company's funds on blackjack, so that — in the event you win — your company avoids bankruptcy?

Of course you would.

Notice: the action is consistent; it is the situation that differs.

And a bit of confession — the above was not a hypothetical.

FedEx, Frederick W. Smith — 1974, Las Vegas.

# OF FREDERICK W. SMITH
Rational actors maximize survival-adjusted utility. Under normal circumstances, we balance for distribution payoffs and potential risks associated. The thing is, when downside equals extinction, convexity flips. What we would otherwise consider "absurd" becomes optimal.

Think back to Frederick W. Smith. The status quo was banrkuptcy, and FedEx's certain death. Gambling, in this instance, would amount to small probability of survival. Gambling, then, becomes the optimal path given that the expected value (EV) is above 0, relative to certain ruin.

Think of it as last-resort convexity.

The nuclear options only becomes rational when:
- The conventional defeat probability reaches certainty.
- Regime survival probability collapses near to zero.
- Negotiated settlement probability collapses.

At that point:
- The downside (of bankruptcy, annihilation, or death) is already embedded.
- The only remaining positive EV path is escalation.

> The nuclear escalation is only madness when viewed from an outside perspective, ignoring completely the actor's current circumstance. The nuclear escalation is a convexity trade taken when the baseline for survival collapses.

# OF MARKETS
Apple, 1997.

90 days of cash left.
Product line chaos.
Market share collapsing fast.
Bankruptcy imminent.

Base case scenario? Extinction.

What would the nuclear option be?

Bring back Steve Jobs.
Kill almost all product lines.
Take 150M USD investment from Microsoft.
Radically simplify strategy.
Bet the farm on a new OS ecosystem.

How is this the nuclear option, you may ask? Think to how this may look back in 1997.
- Desperate.
- Humiliating.
- Company burning credibility and brand name almost as fast as cash.
- Capitulating to Steve Jobs.
- Accepting life boats from former arch-rivals.
- Betting the entire future of the company on a pathway.

Under normal circumstances, this was moronic. Under 1997 Apple's circumstance? It was the only way forward. Conservatism and "business-as-usual" would not have saved Apple. As an investor in this exact moment, the result was binary. There was no "maybe Apple survives a bit, maybe they take a hit and climb back steadily."

It was either:
Apple dies.
Apple makes a comeback.

No in between.

It would stand to reason then, that if you were an investor in 1997, your objective has gravitated from, "is Apple a good investment," to "will Apple survive this?" Nuclear options are embedded asymmetry, but only if you position yourself accordingly. Plenty of companies pull off a 1997 Apple-esque recovery. Plenty of companies also fail, and disappear into the chapter 11 graveyard.

# OF DISTRIBUTIONS
Nuclear options work only if they raise the probability of survival above the capital access threshold. Below that threshold:
- Credit markets shut.
- Vendors tighten.
- Employees flee.
- Reflexivity accelerates collapse.

Above that threshold:
- Liquidity reopens.
- Counterparties renegotiate.
- Employees stay.
- Narrative flips.

When a company announces a radical pivot under distress, there are only three questions an investor should concern themselves with:
- Has baseline probability survival already collapsed?
- Does this action materially increase survival odds?
- Does the market underprice that probability shift?

If yes, you have yourself embedded asymmetry.
If no, you have yourself theatrical desperation.

Your task is to discern which is which.
